## Git Workflow

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- Never force push, reset --hard, or clean -f without explicit approval
- Always pull --rebase before pushing
- The beads daemon auto-syncs issue changes on the `beads-sync` branch — do not manually commit to that branch
- Commit messages should be concise and describe the "why" not just the "what"
