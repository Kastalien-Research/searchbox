Dispatch the Scout agent to explore: $ARGUMENTS

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "scout"` (the custom `.claude/agents/scout.md` agent) to investigate this topic. Pass the full arguments as context.

After the Scout returns, present the Scout Report to the user with:
1. The structured signals found
2. Cross-domain connections
3. Recommended areas for the Cartographer to map

If the Scout report suggests immediate mapping would be valuable, suggest `/map` as a follow-up.
