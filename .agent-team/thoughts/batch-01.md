# Batch 01: User Type Discovery (Thoughts 1-10)

## Summary
Identified 8 initial user types through first-principles reasoning about who needs structured reasoning tools.

## User Types Discovered

| # | User Type | Entity Types | Priority |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | MCP Ecosystem Developers | github_repo, person | High |
| 2 | AI Agent Framework Builders | company, github_repo | High |
| 3 | Claude Code / Cursor Power Users | tweet, person | High |
| 4 | AI Safety & Alignment Researchers | research_paper, person | Med-High |
| 5 | OSINT / Competitive Intelligence Analysts | company, linkedin_profile | Medium |
| 6 | Academic Systematic Reviewers | research_paper | Medium |
| 7 | Technical Strategy Consultants | company, linkedin_profile | Medium |
| 8 | DevOps/SRE Incident Responders | company, person | Medium |

## Key Insight
Target is broader than "AI developers" -- anyone who thinks for a living and would benefit from externalizing thought structure. Next batch should explore non-tech domains: legal, medical, policy, education.
